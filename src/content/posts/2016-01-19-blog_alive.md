Hello folks.

After many years without touch my personal website, I took the decision to put it back online.

Recently I have been writing technical documentation in Spanish in the website <a href="http://7sabores.com" target="_blank">7Sabores.com</a>. If you are wondering Why in Spanish? and if you read Spanish you can find my justification in the blog entry <a href='http://7sabores.com/blog/se-busca-en-espanol'>¿Se busca en Español?</a>.

I will not translate all my Spanish entries to English or viceversa, all depends my mood :P.

Also I have to say THANKS YOU to two great products <a targe="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="http://spress.yosymfony.com/">[S]press</a>. Without them this blog couldn't be possible.

See you around.
